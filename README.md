# Bench Builder
Creates teams for Open Sports hockey games

## How it Works
Connect it to your Open Sports group (using your Open Sports group ID).  Rate your players, and the app will generate roster options based on your ratings.

## Roadmap Features
* versioning
* saving generated rosters
* refreshing player evaluations (expire them after some user defined interval (90 days?) so that skaters can be re-evaluated as they progress)
* exporting saved player evaluations
